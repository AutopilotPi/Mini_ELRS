# Mini_ELRS

The repo is a hardware design for ELRS(https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS) by Kicad 6.0. The design aim to construct a 
SMT module which could be integrated into PCB of Flight Controller or some other DIY projects easily. 

To lower the cost, there is cut area in the PCB. Because the half hole process in PCB sample production cost mucher higher, 
we can cut the extral area after the PCB production manually.
